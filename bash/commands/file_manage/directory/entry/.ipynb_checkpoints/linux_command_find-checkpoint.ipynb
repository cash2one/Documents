    "#### DESCRIPTION\n",
    "    This manual page documents the GNU version of find.\n",
    "    GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given file name by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according  to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome i  known (the left hand side is false for and operations, true  for or), at which point find moves on to the next file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you are using find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that  are  writable  by other users), you should read the \"Security Considerations\" chapter of the findutils documentation,which is called Finding Files and comes with findutils.That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information."

    "#### OPTIONS\n",
    "    The  -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.\n",
    "    Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories to be examined, \n",
    "    up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument  `('  or  `!'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.\n",
    "    If no paths are given,the current directory is used.\n",
    "    If no expression is given,the expression -print is used (but you should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).\n",
    "       \n",
    "    This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.\n",
    "    These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately after the last path name.  \n",
    "    The five `real' options -H, -L, -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name,if at all.  \n",
    "    A double dash -- can also be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start point \n",
    "    begin with either `./' or `/' is generally safer if you use wildcards in the list  of  start points)."

Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, robust and effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels over time.However, the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation level 1) will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.The findutils test suite runs all the tests on find at each optimisationlevel and ensures that the result is the same."

    "    grep searches the named input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, \n",
    "    or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  \n",
    "    By default, grep prints the matching lines.\n",

    "    In addition, three variant programs egrep, fgrep and rgrep are available.  \n",

    "    Direct invocation as either egrep or fgrep is deprecated, \n",
    "    but is provided to allow historical applications that rely on them to run unmodified."

    "### NAME\n",
    "chmod - change file mode bits  \n",
    "\n",
    "### SYNOPSIS\n",
    "chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...  \n",
    "chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...  \n",
    "chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...  \n",
    "\n",
    "### DESCRIPTION\n",
    "This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of chmod.  \n",
    "\n",
    "chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode,which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the  new mode bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.   \n",
    "Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users’access to the file will be changed:   \n",
    "the user who owns  it  (u),   \n",
    "other users  in  the  file’s  group  (g),   \n",
    "other users not in the file’s group (o),   \n",
    "or all users (a).    \n",
    "If none of these are given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them to  be removed; and = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory’s unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users:   \n",
    "read (r),   \n",
    "write (w),   \n",
    "execute (or search for directories)  (x),\n",
    "execute/search  only  if  the  file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X),   \n",
    "set user or group ID on execution (s),   \n",
    "restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of one or more of these letters, you  can  specify  exactly one  of  the letters ugo:   \n",
    "the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u),   \n",
    "the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file’s group (g),   \n",
    "the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two  preceding  categories (o).\n",
    "\n",
    "A  numeric  mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.    \n",
    "Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.    \n",
    "The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted  deletion  or sticky  (1)  attributes.    \n",
    "The second digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1);   \n",
    "the third selects permissions for other users in the file’s group, with the same values;   \n",
    "the fourth  for  other  users not in the file’s group, with the same values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "chmod  never  changes  the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.    \n",
    "This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.    \n",
    "However, for each symbolic link listed on  the  command  line, chmod  changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.   \n",
    "In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### SETUID AND SETGID BITS\n",
    "chmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file’s group ID does not match the user’s effective group ID or one of  the user’s supplementary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.    \n",
    "Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.   \n",
    "This behavior depends on the policy  and  functionality  of  the underlying chmod system call.   \n",
    "When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "chmod  preserves a directory’s set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.    \n",
    "You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s, and you can set (but not clear) the bits with a numeric mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### supplement\n",
    "##### These section come from Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, 3rd Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "Every process has six or more IDs associated with it.\n",
    "1. who we really are\n",
    "###### real user ID\n",
    "###### real group ID\n",
    "The real user ID and real group ID identify who we really are.   \n",
    "These two fields are taken from our entry in the password file when we log in.   \n",
    "Normally, these values don’t change during a login session, although there are ways for a superuser process to change them, which we describe in Section 8.11.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. used for file access permission checks\n",
    "###### effective user ID\n",
    "###### effective group ID\n",
    "###### supplementary group IDs\n",
    "The effective user ID, effective group ID, and supplementary group IDs determine our file access permissions, as we describe in the next section.   \n",
    "(We defined supplementary group IDs in Section 1.8.)   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. saved by exec functions\n",
    "###### saved set-user-ID\n",
    "###### saved set-group-ID\n",
    "The saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID contain copies of the effective user ID and the effective group ID, respectively, when a program is executed.   \n",
    "We describe the function of these two saved values when we describe the setuid function in Section 8.11. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the effective user ID equals the real user ID, and the effective group ID equals the real group ID.  \n",
    "Every file has an owner and a group owner. The owner is specified by the st_uid member of the stat structure; the group owner, by the st_gid member.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we execute a program file, the effective user ID of the process is usually the real user ID, and the effective group ID is usually the real group ID.   \n",
    "However, we can also set a special flag in the file’s mode word (st_mode) that says, ‘‘When this file is executed, set the effective user ID of the process to be the owner of the file (st_uid).’’  \n",
    "Similarly, we can set another bit in the file’s mode word that causes the effective group ID to be the group owner of the file (st_gid).   These two bits in the file’s mode word are called the set-user-ID bit and the set-group-ID bit.  \n",
    "For example, if the owner of the file is the superuser and if the file’s set-user-ID bit is set, then while that program file is running as a process, it has superuser privileges.  \n",
    "This happens regardless of the real user ID of the process that executes the file.   \n",
    "As an example, the UNIX System program that allows anyone to change his or her password,passwd(1), is a set-user-ID program.   \n",
    "This is required so that the program can write the new password to the password file, typically either /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow,files that should be writable only by the superuser.   \n",
    "Because a process that is running set-user-ID to some other user usually assumes extra permissions, it must be written carefully.   \n",
    "We’ll discuss these types of programs in more detail in Chapter 8.  \n",
    "Returning to the stat function, the set-user-ID bit and the set-group-ID bit are contained in the file’s st_mode value.   \n",
    "These two bits can be tested against the constants S_ISUID and S_ISGID, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT\n",
    "The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type.   \n",
    "For directories, it prevents  unprivileged  users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory;  \n",
    "this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories like  /tmp.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For regular  files  on some older systems, the bit saves the program’s text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit."
